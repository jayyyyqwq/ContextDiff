# ContextDiff — The Developer Knowledge Compiler [cite: 1]

## The Problem
Developers do not learn like beginners, yet every major platform treats them as one. When a senior dev learns a new language, they are forced to sit through familiar concepts, resulting in redundancy rather than deeper learning. 

## The Solution
ContextDiff eliminates this inefficiency by treating learning as a computational diff operation. It acts as a compiler for human knowledge. 

Just as a compiler compares code versions, we compare your existing knowledge graph with a target skill domain, isolating only the conceptual delta[cite: 6]. [cite_start]We do not assume ignorance; we assume intelligence.

## [cite_start]Core Architecture 

* **Adaptive Skill Profiling:** Analyzes linked GitHub repos or uploaded resumes to infer your architectural patterns and paradigm familiarity to generate a User Knowledge Graph.
* **Knowledge Diff Engine:** Performs graph subtraction (User Knowledge Graph MINUS Target Ontology) to prune redundant concepts and output a Delta-Only Checklist.
* **Analogy & Visualization Layer:** Maps new concepts to existing schemas and renders deterministic, side-by-side code comparisons using Mermaid.js.
* **Time-Aware Engine:** Distributes micro-modules strategically based on your available study hours.

## Why It Wins
* **The Reduction Score:** Quantifies the exact percentage of redundant material removed.
* **Deterministic Visualization:** Uses safe, reliable code-to-diagram rendering instead of hallucination-prone image generation.
* **Developer-First:** Built strictly for engineers optimizing for competence, not convenience.
