# [cite_start]ContextDiff — The Developer Knowledge Compiler [cite: 1]

## The Problem
[cite_start]Developers do not learn like beginners, yet every major platform treats them as one[cite: 3]. [cite_start]When a senior dev learns a new language, they are forced to sit through familiar concepts, resulting in redundancy rather than deeper learning[cite: 3, 4]. 

## The Solution
[cite_start]ContextDiff eliminates this inefficiency by treating learning as a computational diff operation[cite: 5]. [cite_start]It acts as a compiler for human knowledge[cite: 9]. 

[cite_start]Just as a compiler compares code versions, we compare your existing knowledge graph with a target skill domain, isolating only the conceptual delta[cite: 6]. [cite_start]We do not assume ignorance; we assume intelligence[cite: 8].

## [cite_start]Core Architecture [cite: 10]

* [cite_start]**Adaptive Skill Profiling:** Analyzes linked GitHub repos or uploaded resumes to infer your architectural patterns and paradigm familiarity to generate a User Knowledge Graph[cite: 11, 12].
* [cite_start]**Knowledge Diff Engine:** Performs graph subtraction (User Knowledge Graph MINUS Target Ontology) to prune redundant concepts and output a Delta-Only Checklist[cite: 15, 16].
* [cite_start]**Analogy & Visualization Layer:** Maps new concepts to existing schemas and renders deterministic, side-by-side code comparisons using Mermaid.js[cite: 17, 18].
* [cite_start]**Time-Aware Engine:** Distributes micro-modules strategically based on your available study hours[cite: 19, 20].

## [cite_start]Why It Wins [cite: 23]
* [cite_start]**The Reduction Score:** Quantifies the exact percentage of redundant material removed[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Deterministic Visualization:** Uses safe, reliable code-to-diagram rendering instead of hallucination-prone image generation[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Developer-First:** Built strictly for engineers optimizing for competence, not convenience[cite: 24, 27].
